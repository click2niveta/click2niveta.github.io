    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> I’m a student researcher and aspiring computer scientist passionate about applying technology to solve real-world problems. From biomedical innovation to environmental monitoring, I’ve worked on projects that merge code, data, and curiosity to create meaningful impact. </p>
    <br>
    <p> My journey into computing started with a fascination for patterns—whether in biology, behavior, or big data. That curiosity evolved into hands-on experience through research fellowships, STEM programs, and interdisciplinary collaborations. I’ve developed tools to assist mosquito control efforts, analyzed genomic data to understand rare diseases, and explored the ethical boundaries of AI—all with a drive to learn, adapt, and contribute. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Outside of the lab or IDE, I thrive on mentoring peers, leading initiatives, and connecting ideas across domains. I believe in the power of tech for good—especially in healthcare, sustainability, and education—and I’m excited to keep pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Let’s connect! Whether you’re working on an initiative that sparks change or want to chat about research, computing, or creative problem-solving—I’d love to hear from you. </p>
